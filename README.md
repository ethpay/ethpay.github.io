### EthPay

EthPay is an open source, javascript, client-side tool for generating Ether wallets.


### Users (non-developers)

It is recommended you start with our help page @ https://www.EthPay.com/#help.

You can run EthPay.com on your computer instead of from the GitHub servers. You can generate a wallet completely offline and send transactions from the "Offline Transaction" page.

In case you are not familiar, you need to keep the entire folder in order to run the website, not just index.html. Don't touch or move anything around in the folder. If you are storing a backup of the EthPay repo for the future, we recommend just storing the ZIP so you can be sure the folder contents stay intact.

As we are constantly updating EthPay.com, we recommend you periodically update your saved version of the repo.
